<h1> FarmCom - System Requirement Specification </h1>

<h2> Description </h2>

The project was created as a part of the Specification of It Systems course in Department of Engineering at Aarhus University.
The document is a requirement specification created in cooperation with Mjølner Informatics A/S company. The specification is based on the SL-07 template made by Soren Lauesen from DTU.

The requirement elicitation process has been carried out through three meetings with the customer from Mjølner. Each one has lasted one hour. The meetings were split into three topics:

1. Initial meeting - including goal and domain level requirements. Furthermore we did a stakeholder analysis and discussed the timeframe for this project along with a matching of expectations.
2. Second meeting - including review of the first document draft, and discussion on new requirements. 
Product and design level requirements were discussed.
3. Last meeting - including a review of the whole SRS, and final comments from the customer.
    
During the periods between the meetings, the group has been working on the SRS, so it was continuously improved, and kept up to date. 

All deliverables have been submitted to the customer 48 hours in advance of our meetings, so that the customer had a chance to acknowledge with the document, and prepare for the upcoming meeting.
